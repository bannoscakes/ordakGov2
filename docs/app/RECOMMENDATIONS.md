# RECOMMENDATIONS (Delivery & Pickup Scheduler)

## Overview

Our recommendation engine provides helpful suggestions to customers when scheduling deliveries or pickups. It aims to improve customer satisfaction, minimize friction during checkout, and optimize delivery operations for merchants.

## Recommendation types

- **Slot Recommendations:** Suggest optimal delivery/pickup time slots based on availability, merchant‑defined rules (cut‑off times, lead times, blackout dates, slot capacities), and historical popularity. Customers see recommended slots flagged as "Recommended" or pre‑selected by default.

- **Location Recommendations:** When multiple pickup locations are available, recommend the nearest or most convenient pickup location based on the customer's address and past preferences.

- **Alternative Time Recommendations:** When a customer's preferred slot is unavailable (full or outside eligibility), present nearby available slots on the same day or adjacent days to reduce abandonment.

- **Smart Scheduling / Route Efficiency:** For merchants using an integrated route optimizer, suggest delivery windows that minimize delivery distance and cluster deliveries geographically. The engine takes into account other scheduled deliveries and traffic patterns to propose eco‑friendly options.

Customers value flexibility and prefer choosing time slots that fit their schedules; offering recommended slots improves convenience and satisfaction, as experts note that providing delivery time options fosters positive customer perception and loyalty【468760664942197†L395-L402】.

## Data model impact

To support recommendations, extend the existing data model:

- Add a `recommendation_score` field to each generated `slot` record to store relative ranking.
- Store customer historical data (e.g., previously selected slots, preferred days) in a `customer_preferences` table or metafield.
- Maintain location coordinates for each pickup location to calculate distances.
- Consider a `recommendation_log` table for auditing which recommendations were shown and selected.

## API & events

- **POST /recommendations/slots** – Given a cart and customer info (postcode, products, location), return a list of available slots with recommendation scores and labels (e.g., `recommended: true`).
- **POST /recommendations/locations** – Given a postcode/address, return nearby pickup locations ranked by proximity and capacity.
- **Webhook** `recommendation.viewed` – Triggered when a customer views recommended slots; includes session ID and recommended options.
- **Webhook** `recommendation.selected` – Triggered when a customer selects a recommended slot or location; helps merchants analyze adoption.

## Algorithms & heuristics

- **Scoring:** Combine factors such as remaining capacity (`slots_remaining / slot_capacity`), distance from other deliveries, driver availability, and customer preferences to compute a score. Assign higher scores to slots with more capacity and shorter estimated delivery times.
- **Popularity Boost:** For popular slots (e.g., Friday afternoon), increase score slightly if capacity remains. Avoid recommending slots that are nearly full.
- **Geographic Clustering:** Use a geodesic distance function to group deliveries; recommend slots that serve nearby orders to improve route efficiency.
- **Personalization:** Use past selections to bias recommendations towards similar days or times. For example, if a customer often chooses Saturday mornings, weight Saturday morning slots higher.

## UI integration

- In the storefront widget (product page, cart, drawer), highlight the top recommended slot and label it "Recommended".
- If the recommended slot differs from the default merchant configuration, show a small note explaining why it is suggested (e.g., "Recommended for faster delivery").
- Allow customers to view all available slots, but preselect the recommended one.
- In the admin portal, provide a settings page to configure recommendation behavior (e.g., weighting factors, number of suggestions).

## Constraints & considerations

- Recommendations must respect all eligibility rules: postcode validation, business hours, cut‑off times, lead times, blackout dates, slot capacities, and location‑specific restrictions.
- Do not over‑personalize; ensure recommendations remain impartial and do not discriminate.
- Provide a fallback when recommendation service is unavailable; default to chronological slot listing.
- Monitor performance to ensure recommendation queries do not slow down checkout.

## Future enhancements

- Integrate machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a slot being chosen based on past selection patterns and external signals (weather, events).
- Implement demand shaping by offering incentives or dynamic pricing for off‑peak slots.
- Surface recommendations via email or SMS reminders when customers abandon the checkout without choosing a slot.
