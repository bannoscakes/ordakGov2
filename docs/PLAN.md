# PLAN — what's next for Ordak Go

Last updated: 2026-05-02 — Phase A (PR #39) and Phase B (PR #40) merged into `Dev`.

## Where we are

✅ **Foundation done:**
- Stack upgraded to current Shopify SDKs (Polaris 13, app-remix 4.2, shopify-api 13, Prisma 6.19, Vite 5)
- Linked to Partners app **Ordak Go** under **P&T Group** org
- Supabase project provisioned, schema migrated
- Dev store `ordak-go-dev.myshopify.com` created
- App installs on dev store via token-exchange auth, embedded admin renders, webhooks fire, DB writes confirmed
- 0 TypeScript errors, production build passes

✅ **Phase A · Cart app block (theme app extension) — merged 2026-05-02 (PR #39):**
- `extensions/cart-block/` — Preact theme app extension, gzipped bundle 12.5KB (under the 35KB budget). Source split into `extensions/_cart-block-src/` so Shopify CLI's strict "only assets/blocks/locales/snippets" enforcement passes.
- 5 storefront proxy routes (`apps.proxy.eligibility.check`, `recommendations.{locations,slots}`, `events.recommendation-{viewed,selected}`) all wired through `app/utils/app-proxy.server.ts` `appProxyAction()` helper that authenticates and pins `shopDomain`/`shopifyDomain` from session.
- One-command dev loop: `npm run dev:up` / `dev:down` / `dev:logs`. Stable named cloudflared tunnel `ordak-go-dev` permanently routed via Cloudflare DNS to `https://dev.ordak.vip`.
- afterAuth `prisma.shop.upsert` so api.* handlers find a Shop row on fresh installs.
- 6 admin form routes (locations.new/$id, zones.new/$id, rules.new/$id) switched from raw `<form method="post">` to Remix's `<Form>`.

✅ **Phase B · Carrier Service (the checkout lock) — merged 2026-05-02 (PR #40):**
- `Shop.carrierServiceId` column + migration `20260502075923_add_carrier_service_id`.
- `app/services/carrier-service.server.ts` — register/unregister via Admin GraphQL `carrierServiceCreate` / `carrierServiceDelete`.
- `app/routes/api.carrier-service.rates.tsx` — POST callback that branches on `_delivery_method` line item property (pickup → \$0 single rate, delivery → rate per matching zone's location, empty rates outside any zone — gates checkout).
- afterAuth registers if `carrierServiceId` is null; webhook unregisters on APP_UNINSTALLED. The unregister and the Shop-row delete are decoupled so neither one's failure blocks the other.

❌ **Critical gaps blocking v1 install on Bannos + Flour Lane:**
1. ~~No theme app extension~~ — Phase A ✓
2. ~~No Carrier Service~~ — Phase B ✓
3. **No verified end-to-end order pipeline** — webhook tagging logic exists but hasn't been tested with the real cart attribute → order flow (Phase C, next)
4. **No checkout-mode lock** — picking Pickup in the cart still shows the Delivery address form at checkout. Carrier Service can't fix this; needs a Shopify Function (`purchase.delivery-customization.run`) — Phase C.5. *This is one of the headline product goals (no checkout confusion) — it cannot ship to Bannos without this.*
5. Two admin routes stubbed (setup wizard, reschedule) — usable but feature-incomplete (Phase D)
6. Cart-block doesn't yet write `_delivery_method`/`_slot_id`/etc. as line item properties, which Phase B's Carrier Service callback needs to read. Defer to Phase C since it ties into the cart→order pipeline anyway.

⚠️ **Deferred (not v1 blockers):**
- Privacy policy contact info, App Store icon/screenshots/listing — for v2
- Production hosting on Vercel — for v1 install on real shops; can defer if testing on dev store first
- npm audit vulnerabilities
- Webhook subscriptions migrated to toml (currently in code; works, but legacy)
- Performance/accessibility audit on the new cart block (Built for Shopify standards)

## The plan — 6 phases, each its own PR off `Dev`

### Phase A · Cart app block — DONE (PR #39)

See "Where we are" above.

### Phase B · Carrier Service — DONE (PR #40)

See "Where we are" above.

### Phase C · Order pipeline verification — NEXT
Closes the loop: cart attributes → Shopify order → existing `webhooks.orders.create` handler → tags/metafields → manufacturing system reads.

- **Cart-block writes** `_delivery_method`, `_slot_id`, `_slot_date`, `_slot_time_start`, `_slot_time_end`, `_location_id` as `_`-prefixed line item properties on every line (via `/cart/change.js`). Same info as cart attributes but propagates into Carrier Service rate requests and order line items.
- Verify `webhooks.orders.create.tsx` correctly reads our cart attributes/line item properties (currently expects an `OrderLink` to already exist; needs adjustment to create one from cart context if not yet linked).
- Decrement slot `booked` count when order is created.
- Apply tags/metafields/note (already implemented; verify it runs).
- End-to-end test on `ordak-go-dev`: place a real test order → see Shopify order with our scheduling tags → confirm payload shape matches what `bannoscakes-ordak-ui` Edge Functions expect.
- Reserve `WebhookDestination` table in schema (no UI/runtime; design-now-build-later per business requirement).

**Estimate:** 0.5–1 day. **Branch:** `feat/order-pipeline`.

### Phase C.5 · Delivery Customization Function — VERIFIED LIVE (PR #42)

**Tagged:** `v0.5.0-pickup-checkout-locked` (commit `ec9ed6b`, app version `ordak-go-18`).

**Headline product goal achieved:** the cart-stage Pickup/Delivery choice locks the checkout shipping options. Customer cannot override at checkout. No native Ship/Pickup tabs. Verified live on `ordak-go-dev`.

What landed (PR #42, branch `feat/delivery-customization`):
- New extension `extensions/delivery-rate-filter/` — TypeScript Shopify Function (target `cart.delivery-options.transform.run`) compiled to Wasm. Reads `_delivery_method` from cart line item attributes (preferred) OR cart-level `delivery_method` attribute (fallback). Hides delivery options whose `deliveryMethodType` AND handle/title/code don't match the cart-stage choice. Pickup pattern: `pickup|pick-up|in-store|click-and-collect|collect`.
- 6 vitest fixtures, all passing.
- Scope additions: `write_delivery_customizations`, `write_shipping`.
- Self-install convenience routes (Phase D will replace with merchant UI):
  - `/app/install-delivery-customization` — registers function as active DeliveryCustomization
  - `/app/install-carrier-service` — re-registers carrier service for shops that missed `afterAuth`
  - `/app/install-webhooks` — re-runs `shopify.registerWebhooks` for newly-declared topics
  - `/app/setup-au-shipping` — programs the AU shipping zone with both flat rates
  - `/app/backfill-orders` — re-runs orders/create handler against orders missed by webhook
- ORDERS_CREATE webhook topic added to `shopify.server.ts` `webhooks:` config (was missing).

**Live setup (working baseline, all configured on `ordak-go-dev`):**
- Markets: Australia enabled
- Shipping zone "Australia" with flat rates: "Standard delivery" $15 AUD + "Pickup at Annandale" $0 AUD
- Shopify-native Local Pickup: OFF on every location (otherwise tabs override our lock)
- Delivery customization installed and enabled
- Protected Customer Data: "Store management, App functionality" reasons selected (required for ORDERS_CREATE subscription)

**Production install on Bannos** will need:
- Same shipping zone setup (their existing AU zones likely already cover it)
- Local Pickup OFF on locations
- Protected Customer Data approval as part of App Store submission (Phase E)
- Re-run the install convenience routes once after install

### Phase D · Restore stubbed admin
- `app.setup.tsx`: rebuild setup wizard against current schema (use `postalCode` not `postcode`, `type` not `ruleType`, RangeSlider v13 onChange signature, proper discriminated-union narrowing for action data)
- `app.orders.$orderId.reschedule.tsx`: rebuild admin reschedule (FormData typing, narrowing)
- Polish pass on existing admin routes (implicit-any warnings, the `as any` on metafield service GraphQL client)
- Add `logger.error` to all 8 admin-form catch blocks (tracked as task #19 — silent-failure review finding from PR #39).
- Investigate Polaris NavMenu prefetch 404s (`/app/se*.recommendations` etc. — task #13).

**Estimate:** 1 day. **Branch:** `feat/restore-admin`. Can ship to v1 without this if the manual setup steps in the current placeholder are acceptable.

### Phase E · App Store readiness
Defer until A–D land and dev-store testing is solid.

- Privacy policy: replace placeholder text with real contact info
- App Store assets: icon (1200×1200), 3–5 screenshots, listing copy
- Production hosting: deploy to Vercel, set environment variables, smoke-test with `bannoscakes` dev store from production
- Migrate webhook subscriptions to toml (declarative)
- Implement remaining stack-rot defense layers: deprecation alarm, quarterly upgrade cron, Renovate config (see `memory/stack_rot_defense.md`)
- Performance audit: Lighthouse ≥90, bundle size ≤35KB
- Accessibility audit
- Rate limiting on public API routes
- Run security audit: `npm audit fix`, address remaining issues
- afterAuth + carrier-service registration don't fire on token-exchange refresh (only on initial install) — task #12. Existing installs need uninstall+reinstall to bootstrap. Either fix the SDK hook or add a reconciliation cron.
- Surface `Shop.carrierServiceId IS NULL` in the admin home banner so a failed registration is visible to the merchant instead of a silent broken checkout.

**Estimate:** 2–3 days, parallelizable with merchant testing.

## Suggested order of operations

1. ~~**Phase A** now (cart block)~~ — done
2. ~~**Phase B** immediately after (carrier service)~~ — done
3. **Phase C** next — verify the end-to-end works on dev store, fold in cart-block line-item-property writes
4. **Phase C.5** immediately after — the delivery customization function so checkout matches the cart-stage choice (load-bearing for the "no checkout confusion" product goal — install on Bannos waits for this)
5. **Install on Bannos as the canary** — manual smoke testing on a real shop with real (test) orders
6. **Install on Flour Lane** once Bannos is stable
7. **Phase D** in parallel with Bannos rollout (admin gaps don't block customer-facing flow)
8. **Phase E** after both stores are live and stable

## Out of scope for now

- Plug-in webhook destination feature (per business requirement: "design pluggable now, build later" — schema reservation only in Phase C)
- Checkout UI Extension (Plus only; not relevant for Bannos/Flour Lane unless they go Plus)
- ML-driven slot recommendations (current weighted-scoring algorithm is sufficient; future enhancement)
- Multi-language / i18n (not on the v1 path)

## Decision log

- **Why theme app extension and not just better script tags?** Built for Shopify won't accept script tags for new apps; theme app extensions install via merchant theme editor and are versioned by Shopify, surviving theme updates and Shopify changes.
- **Why Carrier Service over Checkout UI Extension?** Checkout UI Extensions require Shopify Plus. Carrier Service works on all plans and gates the available shipping rates, achieving the same "lock the choice" outcome.
- **Why hold off Prisma 7?** Its config-file rearchitecture isn't yet supported by Shopify's Prisma session-storage adapter (peers `^6.19.0`). Will revisit when adapter catches up.
- **Why no direct ordak delivery integration in v1?** The existing `bannoscakes-ordak-ui` manufacturing system (Vite + Supabase) already consumes Shopify webhooks and forwards delivery orders to ordak.com.au → ordak delivery. Ordak Go's job is upstream of that: tag the Shopify order with scheduling info so the existing Edge Functions read it. See `memory/integration_target.md`.
- **Why line item properties instead of cart attributes for the Carrier Service contract?** Shopify's Carrier Service rate-request body does NOT include `note_attributes`. Only `origin / destination / items / currency`. Cart-block must mirror the cart attributes onto every line as `_`-prefixed properties, which DO appear at `rate.items[*].properties` and at order line items. Documented in `app/routes/api.carrier-service.rates.tsx`.
- **Why a Delivery Customization Function in addition to Carrier Service?** Carrier Service can only return shipping rates — it cannot toggle Shopify checkout's mode (delivery vs pickup) or hide irrelevant rates. The legacy Local Delivery app's headline behavior ("the choice you made in cart determines what you see at checkout — no confusion") requires Shopify Functions with target `purchase.delivery-customization.run`. Available on all plans, deploys with the app, surfaces under Settings → Shipping and delivery → Delivery customizations.
